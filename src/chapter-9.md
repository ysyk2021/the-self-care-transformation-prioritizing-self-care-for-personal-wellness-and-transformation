Self-care is not only important for personal well-being, but it can also be a tool for social change. However, it's important to recognize and address systemic issues that impact self-care and work towards creating inclusive and equitable self-care practices. In this chapter, we will explore these issues and strategies for using self-care as a tool for social change.

Addressing Systemic Issues that Impact Self-Care
------------------------------------------------

Systemic issues such as poverty, racism, and discrimination can impact an individual's ability to prioritize self-care. It's important to recognize these issues and work towards addressing them in order to create a more just and equitable society where all individuals have the ability to prioritize their own well-being.

Using Self-Care as a Tool for Social Change
-------------------------------------------

Self-care can also be used as a tool for social change by promoting resilience and empowerment. By prioritizing self-care, individuals can build resiliency and better cope with the stress and trauma of systemic oppression. Additionally, self-care can promote empowerment by helping individuals to recognize their own worth and value, and to prioritize their own needs and well-being.

Creating Inclusive and Equitable Self-Care Practices
----------------------------------------------------

In order to use self-care as a tool for social change, it's important to create inclusive and equitable self-care practices. This includes recognizing and addressing the barriers to access that exist for certain individuals, such as financial constraints, lack of time due to work or caregiving responsibilities, disability or chronic illness, and marginalization due to race, gender, sexuality, or other factors.

Conclusion
----------

In conclusion, self-care can be a powerful tool for social change, but it's important to address the systemic issues that impact an individual's ability to prioritize self-care and work towards creating inclusive and equitable self-care practices. By using self-care as a tool for social change, individuals can build resiliency, promote empowerment, and work towards creating a more just and equitable society where all individuals have the ability to prioritize their own well-being.
